  ### Challenges

- [Fibonacci] (challenges/fibonacci.js)
  - Build the function that takes a integer (represented as the index number of the fibonacci list) and return the value it would be

- [From Twelve] (challenges/fromTwelve.js)
  - Write a function that sorts a list of integers by how far they are to 12,
  and if they are the same distance, by their values. For example,
  if we have a list of integers 0, 3, 5, 13, 19, then the result after sorting the list is 13, 5, 19, 3, 0.

- [Get Duplicate] (challenges/getDuplicate.js)
    - Given a list, can you return the word or words duplicated in the list.

- [Highest Paid] (challenges/highestPaid.js)
  - Build a function that takes a Binary Tree data structure and returns the highest earned salary employee among the company

- [Not Divide] (challenges/notDivide.js)
  - Write an application that find all the integers in a list that do not divide evenly into 3, 5 or 10.

- [Same Tree] (challenges/sameTree.js)
  - Build a function that takes two parameters (two binary trees data structures) and validate they are twins. If they are twins then return true, else return false
